## Features
- Auto Mode for weapon flashlights on rifles and pistols
- Manual Mode remains available (vanilla-style on/off)
- Lightweight implementation (aim/raise based)
- Auto Mode state is network-synchronized

## How to use
In-game, use the weapon actions:

- **Flashlight: Auto** → enable Auto Mode
- **Flashlight: Manual** → disable Auto Mode and return to standard behavior

While in Manual Mode, use the usual **Switch On / Switch Off** actions.

## Compatibility
Designed for items that use the standard vanilla attachment slots:

- `weaponFlashlight`
- `pistolFlashlight`

Should work with most mods that rely on the vanilla slots.
